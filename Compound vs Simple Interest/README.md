# Objective:
The goal of this Excel assignment was to compare the long-term growth of an investment using simple interest versus compound interest over a 30-year period. We started by setting up input cells for the interest rate and initial deposit to allow easy sensitivity testing. Using formulas, we calculated the accumulated value A(t), interest earned, and effective interest rate for each year under both interest methods. For simple interest, we used a linear growth model, while for compound interest, we applied exponential growth. The results were visualized with a line chart comparing both methods, and we ran different scenarios (4%, 6%, 8%, 10%) to observe how changing rates impact the final values.

# Potential Applications:
This exercise helps demonstrate how compound interest outpaces simple interest over time, especially at higher rates and longer periods. This knowledge is useful in real-world finance and actuarial work, such as modeling investment growth, loan repayment schedules, and retirement planning. The use of input cells and dynamic formulas also mirrors common spreadsheet techniques in the finance industry, where building flexible, sensitivity-ready models is critical for forecasting and decision-making.
