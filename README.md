# ðŸ“Š Excel Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Excel Projects Portfolio! This repository contains a collection of personal and academic Excel projects that showcase my technical skills across various areas including finance, actuarial science, and data analysis.

## ðŸ’¼ About This Repository

Most of the Excel work Iâ€™ve done has been in professional environmentsâ€”such as internships, job tasks, or client-facing reportsâ€”and due to confidentiality, those files are not included here. However, this repo includes selected projects I've built for coursework, practice, or to strengthen specific Excel techniques that I use often in real-world settings.

## ðŸ§  Skills Demonstrated

Across the different projects in this repo, Iâ€™ve applied a wide range of Excel functions and tools, including but not limited to:

- **Logical & Conditional Logic**
  - `IF`, `IFS`, `AND`, `OR`, nested logic
- **Financial Modeling & Analysis**
  - Loan amortization schedules
  - Simple vs. compound interest modeling
  - Investment growth sensitivity testing
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

## ðŸ§¾ Example Use Cases

These Excel skills have been applied in a variety of domains, such as:

- **Finance:** Analyzing loan payments, tracking cash flows, comparing investment strategies
- **Actuarial Science:** Creating amortization schedules, modeling time-value of money
- **Business Analytics:** Building dashboards for coffee sales, customer data analysis
- **Personal Projects:** Budget tracking, sensitivity modeling, Excel automation experiments

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

Each project in this repo includes a brief description, relevant Excel file(s), and often a summary of objectives and results. Some projects may include visuals or charts that reflect the final output or dashboard design.

## ðŸš€ Why Excel?

While I work with Python, SQL, and BI tools like Tableau and Power BI, Excel remains one of the most versatile tools for prototyping, analysis, and reportingâ€”especially when working with stakeholders who prefer spreadsheets. Excel is also widely used in internships and corporate roles, and mastering it continues to be invaluable in both technical and business-facing positions.
